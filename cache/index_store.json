Reviews  by \r\nreviewers are  recorded  for use  in  the paper selection  process. The  database  system  caters \r\nprimarily  to  reviewers  who  record  answers  to  evaluation  questions  for  each  paper  they \r\nreview and make recommendations regarding whether to accept or reject the paper. The data \r\nrequirements are summarized as follows: \r\n● Authors of the papers are uniquely identified by e-mail_ID. First and last names are also \r\nrecorded. ● Each paper is assigned a unique identifier paper_ID by the system and is described by a \r\ntitle, abstract, and the file name of the electronic file containing the paper. ● A paper may have multiple authors, but one of the authors is designated as the contact \r\nauthor. ● Reviewers of papers are uniquely identified by the e-mail address. Each reviewer’s first \r\nname, last name, phone number, affiliation, and topics of interest are also recorded. ● Each  paper  is  assigned  between  two  and  four  reviewers. A  reviewer  rates  each  paper \r\nassigned to him or her on a scale of 1 to 10 in four categories: \r\ntechnical merit, readability, originality, and relevance to the conference. ● Finally, each reviewer provides an overall recommendation regarding each paper. ● Each review  contains  two  types  of  written  comments:  one  to  be  seen  by  the  review \r\ncommittee only and the other as feedback to the author(s). Illustrate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that captures the above information.
